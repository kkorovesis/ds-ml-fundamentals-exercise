# Data Science Machine Learning Fundamentals Exercise

#### Task 1
1. Load the raw bechdel dataset in a kupyter notebook and plot avergae score per year and answer a question regarding movies' score

#### Task 2
1. Performe EDA on the movies dataset.
2. Perform any necessary data cleaning.
3. Evaluate the correlation between data feautres and bechdel test score.

#### Task 3
1. Train an ML model to predict the bechdel score given the relevant dataset.
2. Evaluate the model.
3. How can we improve the performace of the model ?
